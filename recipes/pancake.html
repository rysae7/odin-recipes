    <h2>How to Make Pancakes</h2>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
      <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
